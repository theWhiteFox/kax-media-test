# Task

Implement the attached design and translate into a functional webpage.

This should be available online for us to view. Github pages is a good service for this.

Static designs and their HTML implementations are never exactly the same, but try to keep the HTML page as close as possible to the design.

The HTML should be used in a semantic way, so for example use heading and navigation tags where you think appropriate.

The web page must be responsive, feel free to rearrange the content in a way that makes sense for smaller devices.

Is up to you how to handle the main navigation on tablet and mobile.

Choose a font of your liking and the same goes for images and icons.

Some javascript might be required for the main navigation dropdowns and for the slideshow. You can use any library or plain js.

Page load time is important, so try to use techniques that keep that as low as possible (for example CSS and JS minification).

## Notes

It is a single static HTML page. No other pages are required
There is no need to hook the email box up to any service. Just build the HTML front end
All images required are in the psd
Feel free to replace the video with a static image

## Deliverable

A functioning webpage that can be viewed by entering the URL in a browser.

## Timelines

We understand you will be busy but still need to see evidence that you can deliver so try to get something back to us next week. If there are any problems such as holidays let us know.
